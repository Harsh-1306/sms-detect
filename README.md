# Overview
The aim of this project is to create a simple, yet effective, spam detection system for SMS messages. By using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, the model can predict whether a given SMS message is spam or not.

# Features
SMS Spam Detection: Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam).
User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit to provide an interactive and easy-to-use web interface.
Real-time Predictions: Provides instant feedback on the classification of SMS messages.

# Usage
Navigate to the deployed application here [Streamlit.io](https://sms-detect-iygdnqgbqwdmpthka9px7g.streamlit.app/).
Enter an SMS message in the input box.
Click the "Classify" button to see if the message is classified as spam or not.


# Model
The classifier is built using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which is particularly suited for text classification tasks such as spam detection. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
